###Research and planning
Originally, our team came up with the idea to test the effects of blue light filtering on a smartphone, and contrast this with standard non blue light filtering to measure the changes in one's ability to use the phone with ease (assuming there was a reduction in usability). We did however have to cancel this idea, as well as several others, before coming up with the idea of black on white, white on black text skimming on a high pixel density monitor.

The team performed well on identifying our final experiment idea, identified pitfalls that could arise from the experiment we would be performing, and methods in which we could mitigate/remove these pitfalls entirely.

We found some exceptional ANOVA research on an experiment similar to ours, with our experiment being somewhat of a subset experiment compared to the found research.

The team was always in constant communication, and always prompt to planning meetings as required. Communications with Robert Wellington about our planning/ideas were promptly produced by Brendan, and responses involved the entire team's input. Our project is fairly different to most of the other projects, where it is generally a hardware comparison between 2 devices, and as such, it took a fair bit of time to come up with a reasonable experiment to perform.

I believe next time it would be advisable to come up with a solid idea as early as possible. Our final idea was only approved by Robert quite late into the project timeline, and as such we did not get into the experiment as early as we would have liked. Having now undertaken the study, I can now see how coming up with a good experiment does require careful analysis and consideration.
###Experimental Design
Miguel and I put together a sample of readings which would be used for our experiment, as well as produce the required data collection form and participant permutation samples. As a team, we produced said samples as carefully as possible to mitigate any possibility of maturation effect or  order biased results, thus why we introduced permutations for the order in which readings would take place, and “randomization” of phrases to be located within the given text samples.

The experiment was designed to be performed by one student, under the control and management of all team members performing given tasks. Reflecting on the results we have now got, it is clear to see that the “randomization” of phrase positioning within given text was not quite as random as we had hoped. It was also interesting to see that the randomization may not have even been required. Interestingly enough, I didn't notice any participants looking at the same location as each story was read (maturation effect), but did observe that each participant read the story from top-down. Whether this was just coincidence or accident, I believe the placement of phrase and permutation of story orders at least helped to prevent participation learning of phrase location.
###Execution
The execution phase of our project went well. It took a fair bit of time to perform all tests (48 total tests), with a total testing time of 2 hours for 6 participants.

Each member of the team performed their roles and responsibilities exceptionally and systematically, keeping all test cases under strict control and mitigating any potential external variables. Each participant performed their given tests in their given order with success, we did not have any participant errors or impacting implications on our resulting data.

I would suggest that as mentioned earlier, our positioning of phrases to be found could be randomized further. It seemed that some participants simply skimmed over the phrases on accident, which may or may not have been based on the given foreground/background combination. Something noted by one of the participants is that they often use programs with dark colour combinations, and therefore that may have given them an advantage compared to other participants.
###Data Analysis
The data analysis phase was mostly performed by Brendan as he has a background with data analysis, and therefore he could perform an accurate analysis in the quickest time. I would like to have participated in the data analysis next time, however this time round there was time constraints with other University commitments.
###Overall
Overall, I believe our experiment was reasonably successful. We as a team put in the effort and hard work to produce an experiment we thought stood out from the rest. Considering this was our first ever “true” experiment and data analysis, we could probably produce a better testing data set (stories) next time with truly randomized placement of phrases.

I believe the experiment as a whole could be refined and explored further. Our testing sample was fairly small, and our results were good, but I think expanding on the colours (foreground/background) under evaluation would shed greater light on the effects of text skimming.

###Research & Planning  
As a group we were not that interested a in doing topics that were keyboard related as that has been done to death with previous AHCI year groups, so we eventually decided after some research and consideration of experiment design and time constraints on our topic. I think that if we did not take time to look more deeply into a research and a human computer interaction we were not interested in, we would not have planned or considered certain circumstances for internal validity of the study.  

However in retrospective we based a lot of our fundamental practices and experiment design on it. This could have been improved by perhaps finding more research articles about the considerations of measuring the results in time.  

Also I believe this would have ensured that internal validity of the research would have been improved by more research the Text Structure used. This attribute of  the research could have been our biggest flaw in our research as this may have affected the way people would have read the text and thus affecting the results. Even though I did readability analysis the body of the text could have had some other factors that affect the reader's performance in finding the search phrase such as culturally learned words, font spacing, tacking, size, font style etc.  

Another avenue we had not considered is the ethnography and emulation of a natural environment. I believe more could have been considered in terms of keeping the behaviour of the research subject as natural as possible. Perhaps taking more time to research studies on ethnography experiment design would have aided us to be able to provide a more natural environment and with more natural text samples for them to perform on.  

Overall we tried to ensure that the experiment was invariable as possible by keeping the dependent variables constant, participants of the same set group and mitigating the maturation and order bias to ensure internal validity of the study, although more research could have been done to even further ensure this fact.  

###Executing  
During the experiment I played the assistant role to ensure that the participant did find the phrase and to indicate to adam when they have found it. Although we tried to mitigate the external factors that may affect the experiment and invalidate the data, there were occurrences when this was out our control. One such instance is when there were some people coming in and out of the research room (AHCI lab) as they were using the facilities behind the wall. This may have distracted the participant and made them under perform. Another instance is that perhaps the environment is not a natural environment for the participant. As mentioned before more research could have been made to ensure that the experiment simulated a natural scenario.  

###Data analysis  
I did not play much of a role in data analysis as that instance of work was passed on to brendan. Although at stages of brendans progress we would go through the data analysis he had completed and what conclusions he had made up to that point and checked the validity of the analysis. In hindsight I feel like I should have looked more into the data analysis we were using so as to provide more of an opinion when when reviewing Brendans work together.  

###Overall  
I feel like we worked well as a team and understood our roles. This lead to the smooth transition from planning to executing to data analysis and ensured all our deliverables were processed and completed on time. Although if more time was allotted towards the study thus more planning, resources and participants a more valid and clear dataset could have been created and analysed.

###Research and planning
Our group performed quite well as a unit from the get go communicating early to establish an area of research in which we all were interested in. Our research question and experiment design went over a few iterations but we were able to come to a final decision smoothly. When it came to background research we were quite strong through the literature finding several well cited papers. In hindsight, however, our decision to use a single study (of which influence is unknown ) might have been a weakness because we wanted to test and replicate a single study and its results. 
###Experimental Design
I contributed to the group in the brainstorming process for experiment design and helped come to the final design. Adam and Miguel then both took the initiative for experiment preparation; collecting experiment resources and taking measures to curb order bias and maturation effects for our repeated measures experiment. They also established contact with students who could participate in the experiment. In hindsight our experiment design needed to have more students to participate and we needed to isolate the target-phrase location variable but due to the time crunch and commitments to other papers our need for haste played a role in not taking these into account.
###Execution
The experiment went well. I played a facilitator type role by introducing each student to our experiment, establishing the rules and boundaries. I also aided Miguel by providing him with the correct article to open for each student and then reading aloud the target-phrase before beginning each test. As mentioned Miguel facilitated the experiment by watching the students screen to make sure they followed the confines of the experiment and to confirm that the student has successfully found the target-phrase. Adam started/stopped the timer for each test and recorded the speed for each student for each article. One issue I’ll bring up is that a few people were coming in and out of the tutorial room in which we were undertaking the experiment (which were supposed to be reserved for the experiments). Being a concentration and attention dependent experiment this disturbance to the experiment process needed to have been avoided.  

###Data Analysis
I have a bit of a background in scientific research and have done 2 research methods/statistics papers so I predominantly undertook the data analysis process with some aid from Miguel in his research on ANOVA.
I cleaned up the data, produced graphs, wrote R-scripts but did the final analysis using SPSS statistics. I spent a lot of time ascertaining which ANOVA test to use on the data but once that was figured out and the assumptions for a One-way ANOVA were established, I transformed the data, went through several tests of normality, variance homogeneity, and the final ANOVA One-way test. I mapped this entire process in my data analysis write up with the results and then produced my analysis and discussion of my findings for each stage.
Extra mentions
Miguel and Adam oversaw the building and presentation of the website.  

###Overall 
Overall it was a good research project. My group functioned very well as a unit - taking the initiative and helping other members when it was needed even if it wasn’t their responsibility. I enjoyed revisiting and re-jogging my memory of the entire research process. It helps give a broader view to empirical research.
