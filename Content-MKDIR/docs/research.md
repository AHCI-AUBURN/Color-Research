Vision is the ability that allows us to see and understand the world, it plays a major role with receiving and sending 
information in our society today. Vision helps us to distinguish and differentiate objects in our foveal vision, this helps 
us creates a link of the object and information known about it. 

Our eyes are the instruments to facilitate vision, by taking in light rays and bending them
The eye is able to focus on objects in various lighting conditions. When there is a great deal of light shone into the eye, 
the iris constrains the size of the pupil. This reduces the amount of light and adjusts its focus with its reshaping lens, 
this is also true for the opposite. 

With that being stated a research paper on the legibility of display units through contrast reversal found that people 
were more accurate at reading dark text on a light background. In fact, black text on a white background was found to 
be 26% more accurate than reading white text on a black background (Pace & Cavonius 1980). This research article seemed 
to infer that there should be a significant difference in readability between black text on white versus white text on 
black background.

White text on a black background is not considered to be harder to read in paragraphs compared black text on a white background. 
This is the case since the white characters reflected light is scattered amongst its neighboring letters and words resulting in a 
less distinct character (Anthony 2011)(Oddie 2014). This then affects the readability of a body of text negatively as the reader 
would have a harder time identifying the letters, words, and phrases. This is the opposite with black text on a white background 
as the black text absorbs the light, thus being easier to read.
