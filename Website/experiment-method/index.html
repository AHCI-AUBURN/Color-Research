<h2 id="what-is-repeated-measure-experiment">What is Repeated measure experiment</h2>
<p>Repeated measure uses the same subjects with every test case of the experiment
Show the relationship between two related variable.This is done by repeating the same experiment with the same person being measured more than once on the same dependent variable and with different levels of independent variables. Repeated measure experiments allow for a reduced amount of variance, hence this allows for statistical inferencing to be possible with a small number of subjects.</p>
<h2 id="goals-of-the-repeated-measure-experiment">Goals of the repeated measure experiment</h2>
<p>To replicate  the findings of previous research and see if black text on white background is more readable (scanning for text) than white text on black background on a high refresh rate screen.
Research question: “Is white text on black background better than black text on white background for scan reading on a high refresh rate screen?”
Research question: “Is scan-reading for a target phrase easier on white text on black background versus black text on white background on a high refresh rate screen?”</p>
<h3 id="experiment-design">Experiment Design</h3>
<p>Sample Size: 8<br />
Participant Size: 6<br />
Total: 48 total tests<br />
Subjects : Third year BCIS<br />
Texts Used : Uncommon stories at an 8th grade reading level  </p>
<h2 id="counterbalancing-the-experiment-for-internal-validity">Counterbalancing the experiment for Internal Validity</h2>
<p>To reduce maturation effects of the subjects learning where the phrases were located, we randomly selected the location either the top, middle or bottom of the page. We also ensured that each phrases body was distinctly different in content to any other phrase in the experiment. Furthermore the set of texts order was unique for each subject (a permutation), this was implemented to ensure that there was no order bias affecting the results of  the study.</p>
<p>Boredom and fatigue was also assessed by giving the subject simple interesting stories of varying backgrounds. These texts have also been measured to be readable by a conversational english speaker at an 8th grade level with the Flesch Readability score (Flesch). This was to ensure that the subjects ability to scan for the phrase was not heavily based on their ability to read the English language. Further the texts attributes were analyzed to limit the length a word count of just under 500 words. This was to ensure that the subject scanning for the word would not feel overwhelmed with the content if they could not find the phrase the first time scanning down the page. Another attribute that was measured was the frequency of any given phrase within the text’s body, this allowed us to select a phrase that was unique (Text Analyser).</p>
<h2 id="test-method">Test Method</h2>
<p>The method we have used for testing our theory has been to test a collection of students in a repeated measure experiment. Our participant sample was a total size of 6 students.</p>
<p>The repeated measure experiment we have performed has consisted of each student reading from 8 text samples we have compiled. 4 samples are black background, with white text, and 4 samples are white background, with black text. </p>
<p>Each sample is 1 page in length, and is an extract from a children's story. Each story has been evaluated for suitability of reading, based on the Flesch Readability Scale, and has been ranked as suitable for a 10 year old child, as to avoid the issue of each participant's ability to read.</p>
<p>We have taken into account 2 possible issues whilst undertaking the repeated measure experiment with our participants, and have provided solutions to said possibilities:</p>
<h2 id="order-biased-results">Order Biased Results:</h2>
<p>Onwuegbuzie (2000) has said that Order Bias is the result of participants partaking a study, where all participants are exposed and measured under the same intervention conditions every time. This consistency results in a threat to the internal validity of the data there is no given separation of order of individual participation intervention conditions and the effect of the participation intervention conditions (Onwuegbuzie, 2000).</p>
<p>In order to mitigate the effect of Order Biased results, we have opted to put each student through the test by permuting the order in which they read the 8 stories. Each story has been labeled with a number 1 through 8 inclusive, and then a permutation of 1 through 8 inclusive has been produced and assigned to each of the participants within the test. No 2 permutations where the same.</p>
<h2 id="maturation-effect">Maturation Effect:</h2>
<p>Onwuegbuzie (2000) has also stated that the Maturation effect is something that can occur within a participant during a study, where the participants “state” is altered, particularly over time of the studies duration. These changes lead to a number of alterations to the participant, including; aging, boredom, fatigue, motivation, and learning, which can lead to an incorrect evaluation and result of an independent variable (Onwuegbuzie, 2000).</p>
<p>As we would be having participants skim a collection of children's stories in a random permuted order, to locate a given phrase, we also had to account for the possibility of the aforementioned Maturation effect during the skimming process. The issue we had to avoid was placing the given phrase in roughly the same location throughout all of the stories. Our solution to this problem was to select a unique phrase within the text, in a roughly random location. Our test samples eventually consisted of 2 samples with the phrase in the first third of the text, 3 samples with the phrase in the second third of the text, and 3 samples with the phrase in the final third of the text.</p>
<h2 id="repeated-measure-experiment">Repeated Measure Experiment</h2>
<p>Our repeated measure experiment was performed on a one participant at a time (Hill &amp; Austin 1997) to find a particular phrase in a body of text, and no other participants were present during the testing of any other participants. Each experiment was structured as follows:</p>
<p>Participant is brought into the testing facility (HCI lab)
Participant is given the opportunity to read the participation form, and content form, and sign if they wished to proceed.
If the participant agreed to partake, the participant would be told what the experiment will be about, how we will test them, and what our goals for the experiment were. We would then proceed to inform them of how they would partake, being given a story, and a phrase, and that they would be required to find said phrase within the given story.
Once a story is set up, and the participant is ready to proceed, a timer would start and the participant would begin reading the story to locate the phrase.
Once the phrase has been found, we would confirm that they have found the phrase and the timer would be stopped, and the time recorded for the given story and participant.
This would be repeated until the participant wishes to stop (did not occur), or the participant has completed all 8 stories.  </p>
