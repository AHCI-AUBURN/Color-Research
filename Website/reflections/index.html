<h3 id="research-and-planning">Research and planning</h3>
<p>Our group performed quite well as a unit from the get go communicating early to establish an area of research in which we all were interested in. Our research question and experiment design went over a few iterations but we were able to come to a final decision smoothly. When it came to background research we were quite strong through the literature finding several well cited papers. In hindsight, however, our decision to use a single study (of which influence is unknown ) might have been a weakness because we wanted to test and replicate a single study and its results. </p>
<h3 id="experimental-design">Experimental Design</h3>
<p>I contributed to the group in the brainstorming process for experiment design and helped come to the final design. Adam and Miguel then both took the initiative for experiment preparation; collecting experiment resources and taking measures to curb order bias and maturation effects for our repeated measures experiment. They also established contact with students who could participate in the experiment. In hindsight our experiment design needed to have more students to participate and we needed to isolate the target-phrase location variable but due to the time crunch and commitments to other papers our need for haste played a role in not taking these into account.</p>
<h3 id="execution">Execution</h3>
<p>The experiment went well. I played a facilitator type role by introducing each student to our experiment, establishing the rules and boundaries. I also aided Miguel by providing him with the correct article to open for each student and then reading aloud the target-phrase before beginning each test. As mentioned Miguel facilitated the experiment by watching the students screen to make sure they followed the confines of the experiment and to confirm that the student has successfully found the target-phrase. Adam started/stopped the timer for each test and recorded the speed for each student for each article. One issue Iâ€™ll bring up is that a few people were coming in and out of the tutorial room in which we were undertaking the experiment (which were supposed to be reserved for the experiments).
