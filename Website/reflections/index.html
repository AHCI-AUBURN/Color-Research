<h3 id="research-planning">Research &amp; Planning</h3>
<p>As a group we were not that interested a in doing topics that were keyboard related as that has been done to death with previous AHCI year groups, so we eventually decided after some research and consideration of experiment design and time constraints on our topic. I think that if we did not take time to look more deeply into a research and a human computer interaction we were not interested in, we would not have planned or considered certain circumstances for internal validity of the study.  </p>
<p>However in retrospective we based a lot of our fundamental practices and experiment design on it. This could have been improved by perhaps finding more research articles about the considerations of measuring the results in time.  </p>
<p>Also I believe this would have ensured that internal validity of the research would have been improved by more research the Text Structure used. This attribute of  the research could have been our biggest flaw in our research as this may have affected the way people would have read the text and thus affecting the results. Even though I did readability analysis the body of the text could have had some other factors that affect the reader's performance in finding the search phrase such as culturally learned words, font spacing, tacking, size, font style etc.  </p>
<p>Another avenue we had not considered is the ethnography and emulation of a natural environment. I believe more could have been considered in terms of keeping the behaviour of the research subject as natural as possible. Perhaps taking more time to research studies on ethnography experiment design would have aided us to be able to provide a more natural environment and with more natural text samples for them to perform on.  </p>
<p>Overall we tried to ensure that the experiment was invariable as possible by keeping the dependent variables constant, participants of the same set group and mitigating the maturation and order bias to ensure internal validity of the study, although more research could have been done to even further ensure this fact.  </p>
<h3 id="executing">Executing</h3>
<p>During the experiment I played the assistant role to ensure that the participant did find the phrase and to indicate to adam when they have found it. Although we tried to mitigate the external factors that may affect the experiment and invalidate the data, there were occurrences when this was out our control. One such instance is when there were some people coming in and out of the research room (AHCI lab) as they were using the facilities behind the wall. This may have distracted the participant and made them under perform. Another instance is that perhaps the environment is not a natural environment for the participant. As mentioned before more research could have been made to ensure that the experiment simulated a natural scenario.  </p>
<h3 id="data-analysis">Data analysis</h3>
<p>I did not play much of a role in data analysis as that instance of work was passed on to brendan. Although at stages of brendans progress we would go through the data analysis he had completed and what conclusions he had made up to that point and checked the validity of the analysis. In hindsight I feel like I should have looked more into the data analysis we were using so as to provide more of an opinion when when reviewing Brendans work together.  </p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>I feel like we worked well as a team and understood our roles. This lead to the smooth transition from planning to executing to data analysis and ensured all our deliverables were processed and completed on time. Although if more time was allotted towards the study thus more planning, resources and participants a more valid and clear dataset could have been created and analysed.  </p>
<h1 id="brendan">Brendan</h1>
<h3 id="research-and-planning">Research and planning</h3>
<p>Our group performed quite well as a unit from the get go communicating early to establish an area of research in which we all were interested in. Our research question and experiment design went over a few iterations but we were able to come to a final decision smoothly. When it came to background research we were quite strong through the literature finding several well cited papers. In hindsight, however, our decision to use a single study (of which influence is unknown ) might have been a weakness because we wanted to test and replicate a single study and its results. </p>
<h3 id="experimental-design">Experimental Design</h3>
<p>I contributed to the group in the brainstorming process for experiment design and helped come to the final design. Adam and Miguel then both took the initiative for experiment preparation; collecting experiment resources and taking measures to curb order bias and maturation effects for our repeated measures experiment. They also established contact with students who could participate in the experiment. In hindsight our experiment design needed to have more students to participate and we needed to isolate the target-phrase location variable but due to the time crunch and commitments to other papers our need for haste played a role in not taking these into account.</p>
<h3 id="execution">Execution</h3>
<p>The experiment went well. I played a facilitator type role by introducing each student to our experiment, establishing the rules and boundaries. I also aided Miguel by providing him with the correct article to open for each student and then reading aloud the target-phrase before beginning each test. As mentioned Miguel facilitated the experiment by watching the students screen to make sure they followed the confines of the experiment and to confirm that the student has successfully found the target-phrase. Adam started/stopped the timer for each test and recorded the speed for each student for each article. One issue I’ll bring up is that a few people were coming in and out of the tutorial room in which we were undertaking the experiment (which were supposed to be reserved for the experiments).
