Repeated measure experiments allow for a reduced amount of variance, hence this allows for statistical inferencing to be possible with a small number of subjects.\n\n\nGoals of the repeated measure experiment\n\n\nTo replicate  the findings of previous research and see if black text on white background is more readable (scanning for text) than white text on black background on a high refresh rate screen.\nResearch question: \u201cIs white text on black background better than black text on white background for scan reading on a high refresh rate screen?\u201d\nResearch question: \u201cIs scan-reading for a target phrase easier on white text on black background versus black text on white background on a high refresh rate screen?\u201d\n\n\nExperiment Design\n\n\nSample Size: 8\n\nParticipant Size: 6\n\nTotal: 48 total tests\n\nSubjects : Third year BCIS\n\nTexts Used : Uncommon stories at an 8th grade reading level  \n\n\nCounterbalancing the experiment for Internal Validity\n\n\nTo reduce maturation effects of the subjects learning where the phrases were located, we randomly selected the location either the top, middle or bottom of the page. We also ensured that each phrases body was distinctly different in content to any other phrase in the experiment. Furthermore the set of texts order was unique for each subject (a permutation), this was implemented to ensure that there was no order bias affecting the results of  the study.\n\n\nBoredom and fatigue was also assessed by giving the subject simple interesting stories of varying backgrounds. These texts have also been measured to be readable by a conversational english speaker at an 8th grade level with the Flesch Readability score (Flesch). This was to ensure that the subjects ability to scan for the phrase was not heavily based on their ability to read the English language. Further the texts attributes were analyzed to limit the length a word count of just under 500 words. This was to ensure that the subject scanning for the word would not feel overwhelmed with the content if they could not find the phrase the first time scanning down the page. Another attribute that was measured was the frequency of any given phrase within the text\u2019s body, this allowed us to select a phrase that was unique (Text Analyser).\n\n\nTest Method\n\n\nThe method we have used for testing our theory has been to test a collection of students in a repeated measure experiment. Our participant sample was a total size of 6 students.\n\n\nThe repeated measure experiment we have performed has consisted of each student reading from 8 text samples we have compiled. 4 samples are black background, with white text, and 4 samples are white background, with black text. \n\n\nEach sample is 1 page in length, and is an extract from a children's story. Each story has been evaluated for suitability of reading, based on the Flesch Readability Scale, and has been ranked as suitable for a 10 year old child, as to avoid the issue of each participant's ability to read.\n\n\nWe have taken into account 2 possible issues whilst undertaking the repeated measure experiment with our participants, and have provided solutions to said possibilities:\n\n\nOrder Biased Results:\n\n\nOnwuegbuzie (2000) has said that Order Bias is the result of participants partaking a study, where all participants are exposed and measured under the same intervention conditions every time. This consistency results in a threat to the internal validity of the data there is no given separation of order of individual participation intervention conditions and the effect of the participation intervention conditions (Onwuegbuzie, 2000).\n\n\nIn order to mitigate the effect of Order Biased results, we have opted to put each student through the test by permuting the order in which they read the 8 stories. Each story has been labeled with a number 1 through 8 inclusive, and then a permutation of 1 through 8 inclusive has been produced and assigned to each of the participants within the test. No 2 permutations where the same.\n\n\nMaturation Effect:\n\n\nOnwuegbuzie (2000) has also stated that the Maturation effect is something that can occur within a participant during a study, where the participants \u201cstate\u201d is altered, particularly over time of the studies duration. These changes lead to a number of alterations to the participant, including; aging, boredom, fatigue, motivation, and learning, which can lead to an incorrect evaluation and result of an independent variable (Onwuegbuzie, 2000).\n\n\nAs we would be having participants skim a collection of children's stories in a random permuted order, to locate a given phrase, we also had to account for the possibility of the aforementioned Maturation effect during the skimming process. The issue we had to avoid was placing the given phrase in roughly the same location throughout all of the stories. Our solution to this problem was to select a unique phrase within the text, in a roughly random location. Our test samples eventually consisted of 2 samples with the phrase in the first third of the text, 3 samples with the phrase in the second third of the text, and 3 samples with the phrase in the final third of the text.\n\n\nRepeated Measure Experiment\n\n\nOur repeated measure experiment was performed on a one participant at a time (Hill \n Austin 1997) to find a particular phrase in a body of text, and no other participants were present during the testing of any other participants. Each experiment was structured as follows:\n\n\nParticipant is brought into the testing facility (HCI lab)\nParticipant is given the opportunity to read the participation form, and content form, and sign if they wished to proceed.\nIf the participant agreed to partake, the participant would be told what the experiment will be about, how we will test them, and what our goals for the experiment were. We would then proceed to inform them of how they would partake, being given a story, and a phrase, and that they would be required to find said phrase within the given story.\nOnce a story is set up, and the participant is ready to proceed, a timer would start and the participant would begin reading the story to locate the phrase.\nOnce the phrase has been found, we would confirm that they have found the phrase and the timer would be stopped, and the time recorded for the given story and participant.\nThis would be repeated until the participant wishes to stop (did not occur), or the participant has completed all 8 stories.  \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nOnwuegbuzie,, A.

Normal panel displays at roughly the same size have a pixel density per inch at  94.1 ppi. A higher pixel density (coupled with applications which are retina ready) screen means that the text will be much easier to read (the text being sharper and therefore easier to contrast from the background). It's necessary to minimize any factors that may impact readability that aren\u2019t what we are testing for.\n\n\n(Brightness) High nits for white and low nits for black\n\n\nThe macbook pro has Low black levels and moderately high white levels. Black level is essentially contrast (\"Levels: The Key To Contrast And Detail - Display Calibration 201: The Science Behind Tuning Your Monitor\", 2013).\n\n\nHigh Refresh rate\n\n\nA high refresh rate is the number of times the image is repainted on the screen. Reading text on an article - the refresh rate isn\u2019t so important but our experiment requires our sample students to scroll through the articles. Having a high refresh rate means the article will smoothly scroll allowing the sample student to scan-read while scrolling. Low refresh rates may reduce the sharpness of the text which may impact readability.\n\n\nCommon machine\n\n\nKeeping all tests on the same machine is good experiment design and allows for differences to be picked up without differences in hardware producing different results. It's also easier for our research group as one of our members has a screen and alleviates the need to source other machines. \n\n\nBetter contrast ratio\n\n\nRetina displays have high contrast ratio of 892:1 (Shimpi, 2016)  allowing for blacker blacks and whiter whites which is essential for this experiment.  \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nMacBook Pro with Retina display - Features - Apple.

In figures 1 and 2 we can see that people did better on average with B/W but whether this is a statistically significant difference requires further testing. \nOur hypothesis \u201cIs there a significant difference in scan-reading time between articles with B/W and W/B contrast?\u201d requires a One-way ANOVA or single factor ANOVA test, however, according to \"One-way ANOVA in SPSS Statistics - Step-by-step procedure including testing of assumptions\u201d (2016)  there is an assumption that data needs to be approximately normally distributed. Looking at figure 3 we can see that the entire dataset is positively skewed which therefore requires us to conduct a test of normality (covered in the next section) to make sure that ANOVA can still handle this data set. \nAnother two assumptions for ANOVA - the first being that there are no outliers in the data (In figure 2 there are a few outliers on both B/W and W/B)and the other ast assumption is the variances of both B/W and W/B being homogenous.\n\n\n\n\n\nData normality testing\n\n\nfigure 4.\n\n\n  \n\n\na.

(2016), the data set is not normally distributed. The sig value is quite a bit under 0.05 which tells us to reject the hypothesis that the data is normally distributed. This is further shown by the normal Q-Q plots for the reverse contrasts as the plots are quite a distance from the regression lines. This indicates the data is not normal. This means that we cannot conduct an ANOVA test without transforming the data to be normalized in which we will discuss in the next section.  \n\n\nData transformation\n\n\nWe decided that normalizing the entire time variable would fix both the skewness value in the data set as well as the kurtosis value (outliers). Using this 2-step process followed from \u201cA Two Step Transformation to Normality in SPSS (2014), we used fractional ranking and a normalization function within SPSS software allowed us to get the best results which we will present below.  \n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive statistics of transformed data\n\n\nfigure 7.\n\n\n  \n\n\nBox-plot of normalized reverse contrasts and their data spread for time/duration\n\n\nfigure 8.\n\n\n  \n\n\nData distribution\n\n\nfigure 9.\n\n\n  \n\n\nData normality testing\n\n\nfigure 10.\n\n\n  \n\n\nfigure 11.\n\n\n  \n\n\nLevenes test of Homogeneity\n\n\nfigure 12.\n\n\n  \n\n\nfigure 13.\n\n\n  \n\n\nStage 3\n\n\nNormalizing the Dataset\n\n\nNormalizing the data set had the desired effect. Looking at figure 7, the skewness and kurtosis values have been reduced considerably.  The outliers issue has been resolved by normalizing the entire variable without removing any of the outliers (shown in figures 8 and figure 9, the histogram shows the data set normally distributed.\nTo confirm this further we conducted a normality test (figure 10) on the normalized variable which shows both B/W and W/B Sig values are way over 0.05 which means we can accept the hypothesis that the data set is normally distributed. Figures 11 and 12 further shows that the data is normal because the plots are quite close to the regression line on both Q-Q plots.\nAnother requirement for ANOVA is variance homogeneity of which we undertook a Levene test with the data set (figure 13). The results show that the variances between both contrasts are indeed homogeneous with a Sig value way over .005. \nWith all these issues addressed the data is now ready for One-way ANOVA testing in which we will compare the means for both B/W and W/B.  \n\n\n\n\n\nOne-way ANOVA Test (Single-factor ANOVA\n\n\nfigure 14.\n\n\n  \n\n\nInterval plot for B/W and W/B Means\n\n\nfigure 15.\n\n\n  \n\n\nfigure 16.\n\n\n \n\n\nStage 4\n\n\nDiscussion of one-way ANOVA results\n\n\nAt first glance we can see the Sig value (p) for the One-way ANOVA test (figure 14) is below 0.05 which means we accept that the means have a statistically significant difference in scan-reading speeds between B/W and W/B articles. Further feedback from the students we were sampling found the B/W articles easier to search through except 1 who stated he developed software in IDE with dark backgrounds and light texts.\nThis, however, does not disprove previous findings in research we used to test this hypothesis. For instance our study did not take into account the location of the target-phrase within the articles.          A little bit of exploratory analysis at the data (figure 16) shows that scan-reading performances line up almost perfectly with the B/W articles. As a result of the random placement of target-phrase - the W/B articles had the target-phrase situated between 20 - 45. The one discrepancy is article 7 which on average took a lot longer for students to search through despite the target-phrase being on line 10. One reason for this could be that the target-phrase was on the end of line 10 meaning the rest of the phrase was on line 11. The entire phrase in article 7 was only able to be picked up by reading each line carefully left to right rather than properly scan-reading the document. This shows an error in our experiment design not taking into account target-phrase location factor having a considerable effect on scan-reading speed(not only vertically but horizontally). We did not take measures to isolate the target-phrase location variable. \nAnother issue is that our sample population was extremely small (6 students) hence the sample may data may not reflect reality. \nFuture experiment design around this area of research would need to take these details into account to give better quality results.  \n\n\nReferences used\n\n\nOne-way ANOVA in SPSS Statistics - Step-by-step procedure including testing of assumptions..

We did not take measures to isolate the target-phrase location variable. \nAnother issue is that our sample population was extremely small (6 students) hence the sample may data may not reflect reality. \nFuture experiment design around this area of research would need to take these details into account to give better quality results.",
